### Bubble Sort O(n²)
- Compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until no swaps are needed.

### Selection Sort O(n²)
-  Repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and places it in the correct position

### Insertion Sort O(n²)
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
